## Land Use and Land Cover Classification

Human activities like farming, deforestation, and urban expansion contribute about 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Tracking land use changes is crucial for environmental protection, urban planning, and disaster risk reduction. Advances in AI and satellite imaging now allow for large-scale mapping of land use. This tutorial explores using Sentinel-2 images and deep learning in PyTorch to automate land cover mapping.
